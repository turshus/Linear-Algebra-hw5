		\question \S 3.1 \# 10. Which of the following subsets of $\mathbb{R}^3$ are actually subspaces? You should either prove that the set is a subspace or show that the set does not have one of the properties of subspaces.
	
	\begin{parts}
		\part The plane of vectors $(b_1, b_2, b_3)$ with $b_1 = b_2$.
		\begin{solution}
			We can re-write the plane of vectors to more accurately represent our constraints:
            \[
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    b_1 & b_1 & b_2
                \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            This is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ and we can prove it by proving that the sum of any two vectors within the subsetis also in the subset:
            \[
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    b_1 \\ b_1 \\ b_2
                \end{bmatrix} +
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    b_3 \\ b_3 \\ b_4
                \end{bmatrix} =
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    b_1 + b_3 \\
                    b_1 + b_3 \\
                    b_2 + b_4
                \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            As we can see, the first two elemetns of the vectors equal eqch other which satisfies this constraint.  We also need to prove that any scalar multiple of a vector in the subset is also in the subset.
            \[
                \alpha \begin{bmatrix}
                    b_1 \\ b_1 \\ b_2
                \end{bmatrix} +
                \beta \begin{bmatrix}
                    b_3 \\ b_3 \\ b_4
                \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            \[
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    \alpha \cdot b_1 \\
                    \alpha \cdot b_1 \\
                    \alpha \cdot b_2
                \end{bmatrix} +
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    \beta \cdot b_3 \\
                    \beta \cdot b_3 \\
                    \beta \cdot b_4
                \end{bmatrix}
            \]

	\question An exercise using the outer-product method of matrix multiplication. Every matrix with rank $r$ can be written as the sum of $r$ rank 1 matices. An easy way to write a rank 1 matrix is using an outer-product (recall: $\vec{u}\vec{v}^T$ is an outer-product). Construct a matrix $A$ with rank 2 that has $C(A) = span((1,2,4), (2,2,1))$ and $C(A^T) = span((1,0),(1,1))$, you should use outer-products to find $A$. Then find a factorization on $A$ into a 3 by 2 matrix times a 2 by 2 matrix, you should think backwards about the outer product method of matrix multiplication to help you.

\question Suppose that $A$ is a $m \times n$ matrix and $\vec{b}$ is a $m \times 1$ vector. Let $B$ be the $m \times (n+1)$ matrix formed by adding $\vec{b}$ to $A$, so $B = [A \, \vec{b}]$. What must be true so that $C(A)=C(B)$? What must be true if $C(A)$ is smaller that $C(B)$? Explain what must be true for $A \vec{x} = \vec{b}$ and $B \vec{x} = \vec{b}$ to have solutions.
